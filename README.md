# odin-etch-a-sketch
A one-page Etch-a-Sketch site that uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. The user can change the colours of a square container of divs by moving their cursor, mimicking a sketch, as well as make a new grid with inputted dimensions.

## Local Setup
1. Clone the repo (SSH key): ```git@github.com:curiousConductor49/odin-etch-a-sketch.git```
2. Use VSCode's live preview extension to run it locally in the browser!
